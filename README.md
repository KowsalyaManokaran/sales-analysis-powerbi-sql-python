# Cosmetics Sales Analytics Project

## About the Project
The Cosmetics Sales Analytics Project is a complete end-to-end data analytics case study that analyzes historical sales data from a cosmetics retailer. The goal of the project is to uncover actionable insights related to sales performance, product trends, customer behavior, and to forecast future sales using data-driven techniques.

## Tools and Technologies Used
- SQL (Oracle SQL Developer) – for data cleaning, transformation, and aggregation
- Power BI – for building interactive dashboards and visualizations
- Python (Jupyter Notebook) – for time series sales forecasting using the Prophet library
- Excel – for initial data review and formatting

---

## Project Objectives
- Analyze key sales metrics including revenue, quantity sold, and order volume
- Identify high and low performing products, regions, and categories
- Understand customer demographics such as gender-based purchasing behavior
- Evaluate payment methods and delivery status
- Forecast future sales based on historical performance

---

## Power BI Dashboard Overview
The Power BI dashboard provides insights through visualizations such as:

- Key Performance Indicators (KPIs): Total Revenue, Quantity Sold, and Total Orders
- Monthly Sales Trend (Line Chart)
- Top 5 and Bottom 5 Products by Revenue (Bar Charts)
- Revenue by Product Category and Region
- Revenue by Payment Method
- Gender-wise Revenue Analysis
- Order Return Summary
- Delivery Status Analysis

The dashboard includes filters to analyze data by time period, category, and region.

## Forecasting with Python
A time series forecasting model was developed using Python and the Prophet library to predict future sales.

- Aggregated monthly revenue was used as input data
- The model was trained and tested using historical revenue
- Visualizations were created using Matplotlib and Seaborn

This allows the business to estimate upcoming revenue and plan resources accordingly.
